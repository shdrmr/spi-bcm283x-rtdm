# spi-bcm283x-rtdm

Forked from Nicolas Schurando's repo to make the driver compatible with yocto build system.

Original repository : https://github.com/nicolas-schurando/spi-bcm283x-rtdm.git

Real-Time SPI driver for the Broadcom BCM2835 (BCM2708) and BCM2836 (BCM2709) SoCs using the RTDM API.

## Introduction

This RTDM driver is intended to provide SPI communication between a Raspberry Pi running Xenomai 3.0 (or greater, potentially) and a maximum of two slave devices.

## Limitations

The driver currently only supports blocking data transfer.

Possible future improvements would be implementing interrupt-based and dma-based transfer.

## Build

The provided makefile will build the module out-of-tree.
If you are unfamiliar with this technique, you can read the related documentation at https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt.
This requires that you provide, as an argument, the location of the sources of an already built Xenomai-enabled kernel.

Start by retrieving the source of the driver.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nicolas-schurando/spi-bcm283x-rtdm.git
```

Then build against your already built kernel source.
```bash
$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILER=/path-to-gcc/prefix- KERNEL_DIR=/path-to-kernel-sources
```

Upon success, the release sub-folder will be populated with the generated kernel module.

## Usage

Copy the generated kernel module onto the target and load it with the following command.
```bash
$ sudo insmod spi-bcm283x-rtdm.ko
```

The system log should display something like:
```
[   59.577534] bcm283x_spi_rtdm_init: Starting driver ...
[   59.577582] bcm2835_init: Found device-tree node /soc.

[   59.579362] bcm283x_spi_rtdm_init: Device spidev0.1 registered without errors.
```

Once loaded, the driver will expose the two devices listed below.
The number before the dot refers to the SPI interface and the number after the dot corresponds to the chip select pin.
The Raspberry Pi only exposes the SPI0 interface, with CS0 and CS1.
 * `/dev/rtdm/spidev0.0`
 * `/dev/rtdm/spidev0.1`

The driver uses hard-coded values for the Pi 1, but needs to fetch information from the device tree if running on a Pi 2.
For the latter, make sure that you compiled the kernel with device-tree enabled, and that you used the `mkknlimg` tool to add the DT-compatibility trailer.

Finally, below are a few relevant lines that should help you make use of the driver inside a Xenomai application.

His code underwent only minor modifications, in order to make it compatible with kernel-space.
